## About
Inspired by Luke Smith's [based cooking website](https://based.cooking). No ads or bloat, just based cooking. See his saga in three videos:
- [A Demonstration of Modern Web Bloat](https://odysee.com/@Luke:7/a-demonstration-of-modern-web-bloat:f)
- [The War Against Web Bloat Continues...](https://odysee.com/@Luke:7/the-war-against-web-bloat-continues...:a)
- [SoyDevs DESTROYED Epic Style by Based Cooking!](https://odysee.com/@Luke:7/soydevs-destroyed-epic-style-by-based:6)
